# CST-205Project
Our final project for CST -205


### Prerequisites
* Run requirements.txt

## Description

* In the futuer the project  will allow us to take a photo of a plant and it will recognize the plant name and some information about it. There will also be a filter button that will display a grayscale image of the plant and an ultraviolet version of the plant, as bees see it.

* Currently the code is hardcoded, because we ran out of request from the PlantID API, which would give us the name of the plant and other images the plant. It just serve as an example of the rest working.
